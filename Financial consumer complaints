Hi everyone,
I am sharing a project I recently completed.
-Built interactive dashboard: Utilized Microsoft Excel to create a real-time view of Financial consumer complaints
In this project, I used a dataset of a company's finances related complaints, cleaned the data in Excel, created some pivot tables of interesting insights, and used the pivot tables to create a dashboard.
Here is the Link of my project,
